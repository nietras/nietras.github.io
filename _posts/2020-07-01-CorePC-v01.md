title: Core Developer PC‚Ñ¢ v20.08.dGPU - AMD 3700X vs Intel i7-10700 8c/16t with NVidia 2060 Super
---
Assembling your own developer PC is a rite of passage for many 
self respecting developers. Good news is it has newer been easier.
Inspired Scott Hanselman's [Ultimate Developer PC](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/BuildingTheUltimateDeveloperPC30ThePartsListForMyNewComputerIronHeart.aspx)  and
Jeff Atwood's [Building a PC](https://blog.codinghorror.com/building-a-pc-part-ix-downsizing/) series this post explores selecting components for a core
developer PC at this point in time.

It isn't time for me to update my work-from-home PC just yet, though, 
I am definitely waiting for AMDs [Zen 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_3)
and NVidias consumer [Ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere_(microarchitecture))
cards that have just been [announced](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16057/nvidia-announces-the-geforce-rtx-30-series-ampere-for-gaming-starting-with-rtx-3080-rtx-3090).
Especially, the latter looks promising with its new [TF32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) floating point
format and fixed sparsity support for machine learning.

This means this blog post won't be going into detail on actually assembling the PC.
However, I had a request for a possible configuration of a decent
work-from-home desktop PC that can be used both for software 
development but also deep learning software engineering. 
So I thought I would do a write-up of a PC that is:

* Efficient
* Quiet (almost silent)
* Affordable
* Build to last
* Supports deep learning software engineering
* Unobtrusive with no frills, no RGB LEDs, no annoyances
* No wifi (always prefer a cable when you can)

This PC won't break any world records when it comes to performance.
It will knock the socks off most laptops without the sound of 
a jet turbine in your ears, though. üõ¶
It also won't make you pay attention to it with colorful LEDs.
It's a [monolithic black silent box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)) 
like aliens intended personal compute to be. üòÅ

![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HAL_2001_monolith_(color_correction).jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-CorePC/HAL_2001_monolith_(color_correction).jpg)

The premise is pitting AMD vs Intel CPUs against each other at about the 
same price point. Peripherals are not considered. For GPU there is, in my view, 
not a lot of choice if you are doing deep learning. This is mostly a software 
question. 

## Prices
Prices below are either from [www.newegg.com](www.newegg.com) (US) or 
[www.edbpriser.dk](www.edbpriser.dk)/[www.pricerunner.dk](www.pricerunner.dk) (DK)
for both my American and Danish friends.
Prices are approximate and from the time of writing.
Danish prices incl. 25% VAT.
1 USD = 6.25 DKK.

## Composition
For this blog post I am dividing the components into three parts.
 * **Base** - components that form the basis of the PC and usually have a long longevity and can be the base of many revisions of the PC. This is the 
   cornerstone of assembling your own PC since it allows you to amortize cost
   of some componenents over a long time e.g. ~10 years in this case.
 * **Common** components - these are the common system components that are the same no matter if an AMD or Intel CPU is used. Included in this is the GPU here.
 * **System** components - the CPU and the CPU specific motherboard. 
   Both an AMD and Intel version will be compared.

## Base Components
Base components are often overlooked. If you buy a pre-built desktop PC these often
have lesser quality base components, even though these are the most likely components
to be reused. I encourage picking high quality components here since they will form
the base or foundation for the developer PC for years to come.

#### Case
For the case I went for a micro-ATX [Fractal Design Define Mini C](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-mini-c/black/) case that 
is an updated version of the case next to me right now. It's designed for 
silent computing with built-in sound dampening material. 
How efficient this is I cannot quantify, but
overall I think this is a great case with a good internal design.

[![Fractal Design Define Mini C]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-CorePC/Case-Fractal-Design-Define-Mini-C_16.jpg)](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-mini-c/black/)

The case comes with two decent 120mm fans [Fractal Design Dynamic X2 GP12](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/fans/dynamic/dynamic-x2-gp-12/black/). 
However, if you want better fans and fans that will last a long time 
I would recommend Noctua fans instead. I had to replace the fans that came 
with my case after about 4 years, I think, since they started being noisy.

The one thing that I really don't like on this case is the front panel connectors
are facing up. Since I have the PC sitting in a mount underneath my desk, this
is a bit annoying, since I can't plug in an USB pen here due to lack of height. ü§¶‚Äç

[![Fractal Design Define Mini C]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-CorePC/Case-Fractal-Design-Define-Mini-C_11.jpg)](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-mini-c/black/)


#### PSU
A high quality PSU is essential to a stable and silent PC. Luckily there is 
a lot of choice here now a days. A big question here is always how many watts
the PSU should support. I think there is a tendency to go too high here for many,
unless you are seriously considering getting an expensive high-end GPU 
(like the probable upcoming NVidia 3090) with a similar very high-end 
server CPU 650W should be more than enough for most. It may last you 10 years though,
so keep that in mind and perhaps opt for getting a PSU with some headroom 
for the years to come.

Here I picked the [Corsair RM650x 650W](https://www.corsair.com/eu/en/Categories/Products/Power-Supply-Units/Power-Supply-Units-Advanced/RMx-Series/p/CP-9020178-EU)
because it is completely silent with the fan off when power consumption is low, and
still nearly silent at full load. Additionally [reviews](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-rm550x-power-supply,4484.html) of this are great and it
has very low voltage ripple.

As can be seen below this is a modular PSU. Hence you can keep the case neat using
just the cables needed for powering the components. On the downside this isn't 
exactly a cheap PSU, but given it has a 10 year warranty and will likely last that
long it's worth it.

#### CPU Cooler
For CPU coolers I have one rule: **it must be screw mounted**. 
I have seen my share of push-pin coolers getting loose during 
transportation or similar. Crappy stock coolers should be 
avoided as much as possible. Additionally, prefer coolers with 
PWM fans so the fan speed can be controlled. However, some 
motherboards support controlling the speed by regulating voltage.

I picked the [Noctua NH-12S](https://noctua.at/en/nh-u12s) here since it's 
a very quiet high quality cooler with PWM support and a robust 
mounting system. This cooler has 6 year warranty and Noctua is known for
supporting future sockets via new mounting kits and hence it very likely
will be able to be used for a possible future update and last +6 years.
Replacing the fan is easy too.

#### RAM
Cheap, fast enough and plenty RAM. Not much to say here. As an absolute minimum
you should have 16GB, and always be sure you have as many modules as there are
channels on the CPU. Dual channel in this case. If you only have one module when
the CPU supports dual channel, you only get half the bandwidth. I have seen
this mistake happen too many times. And there rarely is a price 
difference these days. In general consumer CPUs/motherboards are dual channel, 
and high end server CPUs have more. 8 for example.

Be aware of RAM height and CPU cooler clearance here. If the RAM module is 
very high and the CPU cooler does not have a lot of clearance they may clash.

#### NVMe SSD
A key component for total system performance, 
especially for developers, is the NVMe SSD. For OS and git repos this 
is a no brainer. Need more space for other things, add a SATA HDD 
or cheap SSD.

I picked the [ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro 1 TB](https://www.xpg.com/us/feature/583/)
NVMe SSD based on multiple reviews of NVMe SSDs. [Anandtech](https://www.anandtech.com)
has a recent review that includes this in the [The Best NVMe SSD for Laptops and Notebooks: SK hynix Gold P31 1TB SSD Reviewed](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16012/the-sk-hynix-gold-p31-ssd-review) article.

[![ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro 1 TB]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-CorePC/SSD-NVMe-Adata-XPG-SX8200-PRO-Gen3x4-1-TB.png)](https://www.xpg.com/us/feature/583/)

Below I include a few key benchmarks that I base my choice on for a developer PC.
Mixed 4kB and 128 kB Random Read/Write. Note the highlighted SSD is the 
SK hynix Gold P31 1TB SSD which isn't available yet. Overall the 
SX8200 Pro is great and most importantly it is way cheaper than the otherwise
great Samsung 970 EVO Plus by 30-40% while being just as fast or close to.

Again this SSD has a 5 year warranty and should be usable for at least that long.

512 GB should suffice for many here but performance often scales with size.

I have not picked a PCIe 4.0 SSD since there aren't that many yet,
and price difference is still a bit high. More SSDs will come soon. Not the least
the Samsung 980 series which looks [very promising](https://wccftech.com/samsung-980-pro-pcie-4-0-ssds-official-with-up-to-1-tb-capacities/). 
It will probably be expensive, though, but 5,000 MB/s sequential write 
would be nice in some of the industrial systems I work on. That's fast üöÄ
Only the AMD system supports PCIe 4.0, another reason to chose AMD.


#### GPU
For deep learning software engineering there isn't a lot of choice for GPU
when it comes to manufacturer, in my view. NVidia is the defacto choice and this is
due to it's broad set of software libraries like [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt).

Now a lot of deep learning articles claim you can only be serious about 
deep learning if you buy at least a 2080 Ti (now [RTX 3090](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3090/)) or even the ridiculously priced
[Titan RTX](https://www.pricerunner.dk/pl/37-4745518/Grafikkort/Nvidia-TITAN-RTX-Sammenlign-Priser). As everything else, [it depends](https://wiki.c2.com/?ItDepends) on what you are doing.
Sure if you are building state-of-the-art models for [ImageNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet) 
then you need a lot of compute and not the least a lot of GPU RAM, but
for those that are doing real-world industrial vision you can go a long way 
with less if you ignore the "bigger is better" mantra of GPU manufacturers,
cloud providers and people working only on big tech data. There is a lot of
hyperbole here. Real world data for industrial vision is very different from
these extreme scenarios.

Anyway, the main point here was that we need a GPU for **software engineering**.
To be able to run, test, debug code related to GPU compute. For this I would pick
the cheapest, best value latest GPU supporting all features of the most recent NVidia
architecture. That was [Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(microarchitecture)), but is now [Ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere_(microarchitecture)). 

At the time of writing this, the Ampere based Geforce RTX 30 Series is
not yet available, though. And it wasn't when I got a request for my pick of 
components. So I picked the [Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER WINDFORCE OC 8G](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N206SWF2OC-8GD-rev-20#kf), as a good not too 
expensive GPU with all the features of Turing. Compared to the a bit cheaper
2060 this has 2GB more RAM which is worth the price difference. 
The model in question is a no frills version with no RGB LEDs and two decent fans,
that are fully off if the GPU is not loaded. Hence, the GPU should be completely
silent when not loaded, and not too load at load (hoping for no coil whine).

To be clear, I would **not recommend** buying this GPU now that the RTX 30 Series has
been announced. However, if you, as my friend, cannot wait until say October for the 
3070 which is more than twice as fast as the 2060 Super at ~$499, then you have to
live with paying more for less. ;)

Personally, I am waiting for and hoping a 3060/3050 will be coming soon too,
but it might not be before December or next year :( If that's the case I'd get
the 3070 if one can't wait.

[![Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER WINDFORCE OC 8G]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-CorePC/GPU-Gigabyte-Geforce-RTX-2060-super-windforce-oc-8g.png)](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N206SWF2OC-8GD-rev-20#kf)

From Anandtechs [The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 Super & RTX 2060 Super Review: Smaller Numbers, Bigger Performance
](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14586/geforce-rtx-2070-super-rtx-2060-super-review)
the specifications for the 20 series are:

![NVidia 20 Series]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-CorePC/GPU-nvidia-20-series.png)

From [NVIDIA Announces the GeForce RTX 30 Series: Ampere For Gaming, Starting With RTX 3080 & RTX 3090
](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16057/nvidia-announces-the-geforce-rtx-30-series-ampere-for-gaming-starting-with-rtx-3080-rtx-3090) 
the specifications for the 30 series currently are:

![NVidia 30 Series]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-07-CorePC/GPU-nvidia-30-series.png)

Hence, comparing the 3070 to 2060 Super for F32 performance you get 
20.4 TFLOPs	vs 7.2 TFLOPS or 20.4 / 7.2 = 2.83x more at $100 higher price. 
I am guessing that a possible 3060 might have around 14-15 TFLOPS at $399. 
However, more importantly I hope the 30 series will support [TF32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) since 
they share the 3rd generation Tensor Core with the A100, which should give 
a big performance improvement for reduced precision 32-bit floating point 
training/inference. I haven't seen confirmation of this yet, though.
