title: Sep 0.2.3 - .NET 8 and AVX-512 Preview
---

Since [Sep 0.2.0 - Even Faster Parsing (~10 GB/s on Zen 3) and More]({{
site.baseurl }}/2023/08/07/sep-0-2-0/), there have been a few minor releases of
Sep. I will cover those in this post with a focus on preview .NET 8 AVX-512
support and related performance improvements.

## Release Notes

 * [Sep 0.2.1](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.2.1)
   * Reduce row count in comparison benchmarks for faster runs. Reduces memory
     bandwidth impact so better shows code optimization efforts.
 * [Sep 0.2.2](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.2.2)
   * Add `Reader(...)/Writer(...)` extension method overloads with `configure`.
     Fixes issue [How to create reader with separator and
     options?](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/issues/20) reported by
     [nwiman](https://github.com/nwiman), thanks!
 * [Sep 0.2.3](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.2.3)
   * Add preview .NET 8 support with AVX-512 parsing and add benchmark results
     to git incl. Intel Xeon Silver 4316 with AVX-512 results.
   * Performance improvements range from minor 1.05x-1.10x to some very
     impressive ~1.5x improvements for float parsing in .NET 8.

## .NET 8 and AVX-512 Benchmark Results
For detailed benchmarks see [GitHub](https://github.com/nietras/Sep) and the new
`benchmarks` directory that contains BenchmarkDotNet outputs for each hardware
platform that I have access to and have benchmarked (only the 4316 has AVX-512):

* `AMD 5950X` X64 Platform Information
  ``` ini
  OS=Windows 10 (10.0.19044.2846/21H2/November2021Update)
  AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 1 CPU, 32 logical and 16 physical cores
  ```
* `Intel Xeon Silver 4316` X64 Platform Information
  ``` ini
  OS=Windows 10 (10.0.17763.3287/1809/October2018Update/Redstone5)
  Intel Xeon Silver 4316 CPU 2.30GHz, 1 CPU, 
  40 logical and 20 physical cores
  ```
* `Neoverse N1` ARM64 Platform Information (cloud instance)
  ```ini
  OS=ubuntu 22.04
  Neoverse N1, ARM, 4 vCPU
  ```

And .NET runtimes:
 * .NET 7.0.10 (7.0.1023.36312)
 * .NET 8.0.0 Preview 7 (8.0.23.37506)

For this post I am going to focus on Sep results only and what improvements .NET
8 and AVX-512 appear to have. All details can be seen on GitHub incl.
description of the different benchmarks. 

The results below are a bit murky with some outliers that are likely just noise.
However, overall I make the following observations:

 * On the low level scopes (Row and Cols) .NET provides a nice 1.05-1.10x
   improvements. Given I have been spending hours just shaving of a few
   percentages at the low level parsing that is quite significant.
 * On PackageAssets with just separators and line ends AVX-512 gives about 5%
   improvement. However, when there are quotes and about 3x more special
   characters to find there is a 20-30% improvement on top of .NET 8.
 * Finally and most significantly .NET 8 appears to significantly improve
   [csFastFloat](https://github.com/CarlVerret/csFastFloat) float parsing by
   1.2-1.5x! 🚀 I guess this is due to JIT improvements in .NET 8 as there are no
   code changes. Perhaps pointing to that some code in csFastFloat could be
   improved on older runtimes.

ᵇ) No doubt an outlier.

## AVX-512 Assembly Peek
Here a quick look at the assembly generated by the JIT for the AVX-512 code for
the `SepParserAvx512PackCmpOrMoveMaskTzcnt` parser. The actual C# code is very
similar to the AVX2 code, see GitHub for that. Main issue for Sep was some
related code had to be extended to support 64-bit masks.

Below the assembly for the inner loop of the parser is shown. This loads two
512-bit vectors from memory, packs them into 8-bit values and permutes them to
restore order as with AVX2. What is different here is the use of the [mask
registers (`k1-k8`) introduced with
AVX-512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512). However, .NET 8 does not have
explicit support for these and the code generation is a bit suboptimal, given
mask register are moved to normal registers each time. And then back.

This should improve with .NET 9. Although, it is still the intent to not support
explicit mask registers since this would balloon the number of overloads needed
in the vector API. See [post by Tanner Gooding on
mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@tannergooding@tech.lgbt/110758892947524825).
