title: Sep 0.6.0 - CSV Trim Support, .NET 9 and New Benchmarks incl. Apple M1
---

It's been a while since the last update on Sep, but recently 0.6.0 was released
with the following notable changes:

* 🐛 Bug fix to `SepWriter` for selecting multiple columns by indices
* ✂️ `SepReader` Trim Support
* 🤖 .NET 9 Ready
* 🚀 New Benchmarks incl. Apple M1

See [v0.6.0 release](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for all
changes and [Sep README on GitHub](https://github.com/nietras/Sep) for full
details. Below I'll go over the notable changes briefly. Keep reading for perf
numbers!

## Bug fix to SepWriter

Yet another reminder that great code coverage (Sep has ~100% now) does not
preclude any bugs... a functioning brain should. However, sometimes a usually
reasonbly well functioning brain has a day off and it that case wrote a test
wrong which meant a bug snuck into `SepWriter.Row` when selecting multiple
columns by indices e.g. for:

```csharp
var cols = row[3, 2];
```

one would expect columns at indices 3 and 2 to be selected, but instead indices
0 and 1 were selected. A simple mistake fixed by using `colIndices[i]` instead
of just `i`. I would guess no one have actually used this, or hope, at least no
such usage at work.

## Trim Support

Sep supports trimming by the
[`SepTrim`](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/tree/main/src/Sep/SepTrim.cs) flags
enum, which has two options as documented there. `To enable trimming set the
option like below:

```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader(o => 
    o with { Trim = SepTrim.All }).FromText(text);
```

Below the result of both trimming and unescaping is shown in comparison to
[CsvHelper](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/). Note unescaping is enabled
for all results shown. It is possible to trim without unescaping too, of course.

As can be seen Sep supports a simple principle of trimming *before* and *after*
unescaping with trimming before unescaping being important for unescaping if
there is a starting quote after spaces.

| Input | CsvHelper Trim | CsvHelper InsideQuotes | CsvHelper All¹ | Sep Outer | Sep AfterUnescape | Sep All² |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` |
| `·a` | `a` | `·a` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` |
| `a·` | `a` | `a·` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` |
| `·a·` | `a` | `·a·` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` |
| `·a·a·` | `a·a` | `·a·a·` | `a·a` | `a·a` | `a·a` | `a·a` |
| `"a"` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` | `a` |
| `"·a"` | `·a` | `a` | `a` | `·a` | `a` | `a` |
| `"a·"` | `a·` | `a` | `a` | `a·` | `a` | `a` |
| `"·a·"` | `·a·` | `a` | `a` | `·a·` | `a` | `a` |
| `"·a·a·"` | `·a·a·` | `a·a` | `a·a` | `·a·a·` | `a·a` | `a·a` |
| `·"a"·` | `a` | `·"a"·` | `a` | `a` | `"a"` | `a` |
| `·"·a"·` | `·a` | `·"·a"·` | `a` | `·a` | `"·a"` | `a` |
| `·"a·"·` | `a·` | `·"a·"·` | `a` | `a·` | `"a·"` | `a` |
| `·"·a·"·` | `·a·` | `·"·a·"·` | `a` | `·a·` | `"·a·"` | `a` |
| `·"·a·a·"·` | `·a·a·` | `·"·a·a·"·` | `a·a` | `·a·a·` | `"·a·a·"` | `a·a` |

`·` (middle dot) is whitespace to make this visible

¹ CsvHelper with `TrimOptions.Trim | TrimOptions.InsideQuotes`

² Sep with `SepTrim.All = SepTrim.Outer | SepTrim.AfterUnescape` in
`SepReaderOptions`

Trimming has a cost, of course, benchmarks below show this for `AMD Ryzen 9
5950X` when accessing the column `Span` for the package assets benchmark where
most (but not all) columns have been prefixed and suffixed with `·"·`, which
then needs to be removed. For details in benchmarks see Sep on GitHub. As the
numbers show Sep is about 11.20 / 1.44 = 7.78x to 11.07 / 1.69 = 6.54x faster
than CsvHelper for this scenario. Sylvan does not appear to support trimming.

```

These benchmarks were run using .NET 9, but there is no big difference to .NET
8, which brings us to Sep and .NET 9.

## .NET 9 Ready

Sep now uses the latest .NET 9 SDK for development and besides still targeting
`net7.0` and `net8.0`, it now also targets `net9.0`. The main reason being to
add support for `allows ref struct` annotations and `params ReadOnlySpan<>`. 

The former means `SepReader` now for .NET 9+ actually implements
`IEnumerable<SepReader.Row`. However, this isn't particularly useful yet since
.NET apparently hasn't updated LINQ extension methods to have `allows ref
struct` for `TSource` in any such methods. Someday perhaps. 🤷‍

The latter means for most indexing operations `params` is supported and one can
write e.g. `row[1, 2, 3]` or `row["A", "B", "C"]`. Straight-forward and without
allocation since the `params` is `ReadOnlySpan<int>` or `ReadOnlySpan<string>`
and backed by stack allocated storage.

For more details on the API and usage, please refer to the
[README](https://github.com/nietras/Sep).

## New Benchmarks

As part of updating for .NET 9 all benchmarks have been re-run and a new set of
benchmark "machines" has been used as listed below. `(Virtual)` below means this
machine is actually a GitHub CI agent machine, hence, it is subject to noisy
neighbors and is only a subset of the core in the CPU.

* `AMD EPYC 7763` (Virtual) X64 Platform Information
  ```ini
  OS=Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)
  AMD EPYC 7763, 1 CPU, 4 logical and 2 physical cores
  ```
* `AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U` (Laptop on battery) X64 Platform Information
  ```ini
  OS=Windows 11 (10.0.22631.4460/23H2/2023Update/SunValley3)
  AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U w/ Radeon 780M Graphics, 1 CPU, 16 logical and 8 physical cores
  ```
* `AMD 5950X` (Desktop) X64 Platform Information
  ```ini
  OS=Windows 10 (10.0.19044.2846/21H2/November2021Update)
  AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 1 CPU, 32 logical and 16 physical cores
  ```
* `Apple M1` (Virtual) ARM64 Platform Information
  ```ini
  OS=macOS Sonoma 14.7.1 (23H222) [Darwin 23.6.0]
  Apple M1 (Virtual), 1 CPU, 3 logical and 3 physical cores
  ```

This means the previous Neoverse M1 ARM64 processor benchmarks have been
replaced with the Apple M1 processor. Results for this on the floats benchmark
in detail below show sep is ~3x-7x faster from low level to top level. At the
lowest level of just parsing the CSV Sep hits ~5 GB/s vs around 1 GB/s for
others.

### .NET 9 Performance and DATAS Issue

If you are wondering whether .NET 9 provides any significant performance
improvements over .NET 8 for Sep, then no. Some minor within 5-10% improvements
have been observed. This is expected as Sep has been thoroughly optimized to get
as good as possible machine code as possible, so while JIT improvements can
improve this, there is not much left on the table.

However, as detailed in [.NET 8.0.10 vs 9.0.0 RC2 GC Server Performance
Regression in Sep (CSV Parser) Benchmark (due to DATAS
default)](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/109047) the GC has switched
to enable [DATAS (Dynamically Adapting To Application Sizes) by default in .NET
9](https://maoni0.medium.com/dynamically-adapting-to-application-sizes-2d72fcb6f1ea).

Generally, this means the GC is more aggressive with regards to running garbage
collections. However, for bursty workloads like Sep's CSV parsing and the
package assets benchmark where 1 million instances of a parsed package assets
row is accumulated, this can hurt performance by up to 1.7x (for parallel
enumeration) in my testing. Hence, for Sep benchmarks using GC Server mode,
DATAS has been disabled, and I would recommend doing the same if you have lots
of RAM, your own machine and are running machine learning pipelines like we are.

That's all!
