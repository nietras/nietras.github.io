title: Sep 0.6.0 - CSV Trim Support, .NET 9 and New Benchmarks incl. Apple M1
---

It's been a while since the last update on Sep, but recently 0.6.0 was released 
with following notable changes:

* SepWriter bug fix for selecting multiple columns by indices
* SepReader Trim Support
* .NET 9 Ready
* New Benchmarks

See [v0.6.0 release](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.6.0) and
[Sep README on GitHub](https://github.com/nietras/Sep) for full details.

In 




details of these updates and their impact on performance.

## Trim Support

Sep supports trimming by the
[`SepTrim`](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/tree/main/src/Sep/SepTrim.cs) flags
enum, which has two options as documented there. `To use simple set the option:

```csharp
using var reader = Sep.Reader(o => 
    o with { Trim = SepTrim.All }).FromText(text);
```

Below the result of both trimming and unescaping is shown in comparison to
CsvHelper. Note unescaping is enabled for all results shown. It is possible to
trim without unescaping too, of course.

As can be seen Sep supports a simple principle of trimming *before* and *after*
unescaping with trimming before unescaping being important for unescaping if
there is a starting quote after spaces.

² Sep with `SepTrim.All = SepTrim.Outer | SepTrim.AfterUnescape` in
`SepReaderOptions`

## .NET 9 Ready

Sep 0.6.0 is fully compatible with .NET 9, taking advantage of the latest
features and performance improvements. This ensures that Sep remains at the
cutting edge of .NET development, providing the best possible performance for
your CSV parsing needs.

## New Benchmarks

In addition to the trimming benchmarks, we have also conducted new benchmarks on
the Apple M1 platform, focusing on the floats parsing scenario. This scenario is
particularly relevant for machine learning applications, where parsing large
amounts of floating-point data efficiently is crucial.

### Apple M1 - Floats Benchmark Results

| Method       | Scope  | Rows    | Mean         | Ratio | MB  | MB/s   | ns/row | Allocated    | Alloc Ratio |
|--------------|--------|---------|--------------|-------|-----|--------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Sep______    | Row    | 100000  | 36.55 ms     | 1.00  | 109 | 2982.5 | 365.5  | 1.51 KB      | 1.00        |
| Sylvan___    | Row    | 100000  | 98.62 ms     | 2.70  | 109 | 1105.4 | 986.2  | 138.18 KB    | 91.76       |
| CsvHelper    | Row    | 100000  | 225.93 ms    | 6.25  | 109 | 482.5  | 2259.3 | 20.61 KB     | 13.69       |

As shown in the benchmarks, Sep continues to outperform other CSV parsers, providing unparalleled performance on the Apple M1 platform.

## Conclusion

Sep 0.6.0 brings significant improvements with the addition of trim support, .NET 9 compatibility, and new benchmarks demonstrating its performance on the Apple M1. These updates ensure that Sep remains the fastest and most efficient .NET CSV parser available.
