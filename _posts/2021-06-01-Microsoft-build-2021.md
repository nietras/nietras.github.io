### [Announcing Entity Framework Core 6.0 Preview 4: Performance Edition](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-entity-framework-core-6-0-preview-4-performance-edition/)
**Summary:** [Shay Rojansky](https://twitter.com/shayrojansky) covers:

* EF Core 6.0 performance is now **70% faster** on the industry-standard TechEmpower Fortunes benchmark, compared to 5.0.
* This is the full-stack perf improvement, including improvements in the benchmark code, the .NET runtime, etc. EF Core 6.0 itself is **31% faster** executing queries.
* Heap allocations have been reduced by **43%**.

Loving the across the board perf push ♥ It is, though, driven primarily by the
TechEmpower web-focused benchmarks. We need industry-standard desktop benchmarks. 🤞

**Summary:** []() 

You can see a status table of C# language features on GitHub at 
[Language Feature Status](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/Language%20Feature%20Status.md).
Personally I wish for value type records e.g. `record struct`, which is being worked on.
