Digest of the free virtual event at 
[https://www.dotnetconf.net/](https://www.dotnetconf.net/)
held February 25, 2021 with a focus on Windows Desktop development 
and assorted blog posts for .NET 6 Preview 1.

See previous digest from .NET Conf 2020 covering .NET 5 too at
[Digest - .NET Conf 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/11/21/dotnet-conf-2020/).
Much of what was covered in .NET Conf 2021 was released in .NET 5,
so not a lot of news.
