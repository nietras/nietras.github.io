### [Upgrading .NET Desktop Apps from .NET Framework to .NET 5](https://youtu.be/gOWYTA7rNRI)
[![Upgrading .NET Desktop Apps from .NET Framework to .NET 5](https://img.youtube.com/vi/gOWYTA7rNRI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/gOWYTA7rNRI)  

**Summary:** [Cathy Sullivan](https://twitter.com/cathysull) covers the new [`upgrade-assistant`](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant)
for upgrading from .NET Framework to .NET 5. Covering upgrading BabySmash from 
.NET Framework 3.5 to .NET5 and a larger project.

To put it through some rough testing I tried using it on a solution with many projects incl. an WPF application
and several console applications. This had already been ported to new SDK csproj, but is targeting net461. 
Below some notes on what I did in Powershell. 

```powershell
> dotnet tool update -g try-convert
You can invoke the tool using the following command: try-convert
Tool 'try-convert' (version '0.7.212201') was successfully installed.

> dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant
You can invoke the tool using the following command: upgrade-assistant
Tool 'upgrade-assistant' (version '0.2.212405') was successfully installed.

> upgrade-assistant .\SOLUTIONNAME.sln
[Next step] Select an entrypoint
> 1 # Selecting 1 since that is the primary project - WPF app
[Next step] Select project to upgrade
> ENTER
# A list of projects and their order is listed which looks fine
> ENTER
[Next step] Back up project
> 2 # Skipping since in git
# Then proceeds to do conversion (not needed since already SDK project)
[18:23:20 INF] Initializing upgrade step Convert project file to SDK style
[18:23:20 ERR] Failed to open project PROJECTPATH.csproj; Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Sequence contains no matching element

> 2 # The tool continues so trying to skip conversion
[Failed] Update TFM
# However, Update TFM step fails too with the same error
# At this point the upgrade assistant has made no changes to project files
```
Bummer... notorious LINQ `.Single()` exception, seen that too many times. 
Assumptions are always wrong.
Pretty sure our `csproj` customizations are not supported 😅 
Note we have tried changing the TFM to `net5.0` manually and this builds fine, but fails
to run the app with **no meaningful error**. It just stops during startup.

### [XAML Productivity Tooling Enhancements in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/SNP0VolU-tI)
[![XAML Productivity Tooling Enhancements in Visual Studio](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SNP0VolU-tI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/SNP0VolU-tI)

**Summary:** [Dmitry Lyalin](https://twitter.com/LyalinDotCom) takes a tour of what's new for Windows desktop developers building applications using WPF and UWP apps with Visual Studio. Covers improvements in tooling such as what's new in XAML data binding, diagnostics, XAML designer and Hot Reload. Nothing new here. but great things
just released in Visual Studio 2019 16.9.

### [Deploying Windows Apps with ClickOnce on .NET 5](https://youtu.be/Bn0P6ykIijY)
[![Various ways you can deploy desktop applications](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Bn0P6ykIijY/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Bn0P6ykIijY)  

**Summary:** [Olia Gavrysh](https://twitter.com/oliagavrysh) and [Jasmine Greenaway](https://twitter.com/paladique)
cover various ways you can deploy desktop applications:
 * x-copy
 * MSI
 * ClickOnce
 * Windows Store
 * MSIX
 * Third-party solutions

 Which does not cover my favorite for complex installers; **a .NET Framework application with
 the application and it's resources embedded.** This gives you full control over the
 installation experience using normal C# code. This depends on knowing the minimum
 .NET Framework version being available on target machines.

### [An Opinionated Way to Deploy Windows Apps using GitHub Actions](https://youtu.be/35bGh45kGoU)
[![An Opinionated Way to Deploy Windows Apps using GitHub Actions](https://img.youtube.com/vi/35bGh45kGoU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/35bGh45kGoU)  

**Summary:** Great talk by [Isaac Levin](https://twitter.com/isaacrlevin) about how to
automate "deploying" a desktop application via GitHub Actions to:

 * Chocolatey
 * Windows Store

Yaml galore, hundreds of lines of it. Having spent a lot of time on build and CI definitions 
I can definitely appreciate the collected efforts to get all the things being automated working.
Local testing of these yaml pipelines is a huge issue, though, for quicker dev loop.
