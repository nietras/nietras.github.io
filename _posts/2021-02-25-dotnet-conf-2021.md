---

Digest of the free virtual event at 
[https://www.dotnetconf.net/](https://www.dotnetconf.net/)
held February 25, 2021 with a focus on Windows Desktop development 
and assorted blog posts for .NET 6 Preview 1.

See previous digest from .NET Conf 2020 covering .NET 5 too at
[Digest - .NET Conf 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/11/21/dotnet-conf-2020/).
Much of what was covered in .NET Conf 2021 was released in .NET 5,
so not a lot of news.

[![TITLE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/HASH/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HASH)  

**Summary:** [Cathy Sullivan](https://twitter.com/cathysull) covers the new [`upgrade-assistant`](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant)
for upgrading from .NET Framework to .NET 5. Covering upgrading BabySmash from 
.NET Framework 3.5 to .NET5 and a larger project.

To put it through some rough testing I tried using it on a solution with many projects incl. an WPF application
and several console applications. This had already been ported to new SDK csproj, but is targeting net461. 
Below some notes on what I did in Powershell. 

```powershell
> dotnet tool update -g try-convert
You can invoke the tool using the following command: try-convert
Tool 'try-convert' (version '0.7.212201') was successfully installed.

> dotnet tool install -g upgrade-assistant
You can invoke the tool using the following command: upgrade-assistant
Tool 'upgrade-assistant' (version '0.2.212405') was successfully installed.

> upgrade-assistant .\SOLUTIONNAME.sln
[Next step] Select an entrypoint
> 1 # Selecting 1 since that is the primary project - WPF app
[Next step] Select project to upgrade
> ENTER
# A list of projects and their order is listed which looks fine
> ENTER
[Next step] Back up project
> 2 # Skipping since in git
# Then proceeds to do conversion (not needed since already SDK project)
[18:23:20 INF] Initializing upgrade step Convert project file to SDK style

> 2 # The tool continues so trying to skip conversion
[Failed] Update TFM
# However, Update TFM step fails too with the same error
# At this point the upgrade assistant has made no changes to project files
```
Bummer... notorious LINQ `.Single()` exception, seen that too many times. 
Pretty sure our `csproj` customizations are not supported 😅 
Note we have tried changing the TFM to `net5.0` manually and this builds fine, but fails
to run the app with **no meaningful error**. It just stops during startup.

### [An Opinionated Way to Deploy Windows Apps ???](https://youtu.be/HASH)
[![TITLE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/HASH/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HASH)  

**Summary:** Great talk by [Isaac Levin](https://twitter.com/isaacrlevin) about how to
automate "deploying" a desktop application via GitHub Actions to:

 * Windows Store
 * Chocolatey
 * ??

Yaml galore, hundreds of lines of it. Having spent a lot of time on build and CI definitions 
I can definitely appreciate the collected efforts to get all the things being automated working.
Local testing of these yaml pipelines is a huge issue, though, for quicker dev loop.

**Summary:** [Maddy Leger](https://twitter.com/) and [David Ortinau](https://twitter.com/) give a quick
introduction to .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI aka Xamarin vNext), the premise of it and an overview of how 
it works. As always with great enthusiasm. 😁
