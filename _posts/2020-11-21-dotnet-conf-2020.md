Digest of the free virtual event at 
[https://www.dotnetconf.net/](https://www.dotnetconf.net/)
held November 10-12, 2020. See previous digest from
Microsoft BUILD 2020 covering .NET 5 too at
[Digest - Microsoft BUILD 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/2020/06/07/microsoft-build-2020/).


## Announcements and Blog Posts
A few great announcements and blog posts can be found below.
Let's start with some code copied and edited a bit from the first blog post. 
Top-level program example 👍
```csharp
using System;
using System.Device.Gpio;
using System.Threading;
using static System.Console;

var pin = 18;
var lightTime = 1000;
var dimTime = 200;

WriteLine($"Let's blink an LED!");
using GpioController controller = new ();
controller.OpenPin(pin, PinMode.Output);
WriteLine($"GPIO pin enabled for use: {pin}");

// turn LED on and off
while (true)
{
    WriteLine($"Light for {lightTime}ms");
    controller.Write(pin, PinValue.High);
    Thread.Sleep(lightTime);

    WriteLine($"Dim for {dimTime}ms");
    controller.Write(pin, PinValue.Low);
    Thread.Sleep(dimTime);
}
```

### [Announcing .NET 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0/)
**Summary:**  Very long and detailed post about everything .NET 5. 
Highlights from the post copied below: 
>There are many [important improvements in .NET 5.0](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37269):
> * **.NET 5.0 is already battle-tested** by being hosted for months at [dot.net](https://dot.net/) and [Bing.com](https://www.bing.com/) ([version](https://www.bing.com/version)).
> * **Performance is greatly improved** across many components and is described in detail at [Performance Improvements in .NET 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-5/), [Arm64 Performance in .NET 5.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/Arm64-performance-in-net-5/), and [gRPC](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/grpc-performance-improvements-in-net-5/).
> * **C# 9 and F# 5 offer new language improvements** such as top-level programs and records for C# 9, while F# 5 offers interactive programming and a performance boost for functional programming on .NET.
> * **.NET libraries have enhanced performance** for Json serialization, [regular expressions](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/regex-performance-improvements-in-net-5/), and HTTP ([HTTP 1.1](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/41640), [HTTP/2](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35694)). They are also are now completely annotated for nullability.
> * **P95 latency has dropped** due to refinements in the [GC](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/27578), [tiered compilation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32250), and [other areas](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37534).
> * **Application deployment options are better**, with ClickOnce client app publishing, [single-file apps](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36590), [reduced container image size](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1814#issuecomment-625294750), and the addition of Server Core container images.
> * **Platform scope expanded** with [Windows Arm64](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36699) and [WebAssembly](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38367).

### [C# 9.0 on the record](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/c-9-0-on-the-record)
**Summary:** Syntax for `record` (previously `data class`) has changed quite 
a bit since May, this post details the final changes and additions for C# 9.0. 
Records are ideal for immutable message types in pub/sub, CQRS systems reducing
boilerplate quite a lot.
```csharp
using System;

Action<string> log = Console.WriteLine;

Person[] persons = { 
    new ("Anders", "Hejlsberg"), 
    new ("Mads", "Torgersen") 
};
var (f, l) = persons[0];
var otherPerson = persons[^1] with { LastName = f };

log(otherPerson.ToString());

public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName);
```
This will print:
```
Person { FirstName = Mads, LastName = Mikkelsen }
```
***
### [Announcing F# 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-f-5/)

> * Create and use .NET 5 NuGet packages with [**.NET 5 Support**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/getting-started-with-nuget-5-8/#net-5-support).
> * Faster package extraction by using [**MemoryMappedFiles for Faster Writes**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/getting-started-with-nuget-5-8/#memorymappedfiles-for-faster-writes).
> * Search for packages using the [**NuGet CLI Search Command**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/getting-started-with-nuget-5-8/#nuget-cli-search-command).
> * See faster NuGet restores with [**No-Op Restore Optimization**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/getting-started-with-nuget-5-8/#no-op-restore-optimization).
> * Diagnose your package list with [**dotnet list package –verbosity**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/getting-started-with-nuget-5-8/#dotnet-list-package-verbosity).
> * Install prerelease packages with [**dotnet add package –prerelease**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/getting-started-with-nuget-5-8/#dotnet-add-package-prerelease).
> * Verify signed NuGet packages with [**dotnet nuget verify**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/getting-started-with-nuget-5-8/#dotnet-nuget-verify).
