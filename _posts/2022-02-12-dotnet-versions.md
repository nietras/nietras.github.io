### Notes and Disclaimers
* A lot of details are missing such is the art of summarizing.
* A lot of alternative .NET Runtimes are missing; Mono, Silverlight etc.
* Errors are no doubt a plenty.
* Features depicted as part of a version are probably not always representative.
* It is not a timeline since .NET Framework and .NET Core releases overlap.
