title: Sep 0.2.0 - Even Faster Parsing (~10 GB/s on Zen 3) and More
---
Shortly after [Introducing Sep - Possibly the World's Fastest .NET CSV
Parser]({{ site.baseurl }}/2023/06/05/introducing-sep), [Mark
Pflug](https://twitter.com/MarkPflug) author of
[Sylvan.Data.Csv](https://github.com/MarkPflug/Sylvan/blob/main/docs/Csv/Sylvan.Data.Csv.md)
adopted the [`PackUnsignedSaturate` trick from Sep and added a `Vector256`/Avx2
path](https://github.com/MarkPflug/Sylvan/pull/203) in version 1.3.2 for
[impressive
improvements](https://twitter.com/nietras1/status/1669294798652559361). This
meant Sylvan was suddenly slightly faster than Sep at the very low level parsing
of rows only. This I, of course, had to address and [Sep
0.2.0](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/releases/tag/v0.2.0) is the result. 😅

As before the [Sep](https://github.com/nietras/Sep)
[README.md](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/blob/main/README.md) contains the
latest description and benchmarks for the library. In this blog post I will
quickly point out the changes made and go into the performance improvements. 

## Release Notes

 * Replace the "char + position" indexing approach with a "straightforward"
   parse one row at a time approach for 1.4x faster low level parsing.
 * Add line number range (from - to excl) to `SepReader.Row` incl. tracking line
   endings inside quotes so easy to find a row's lines in notepad or similar.
 * Add `SepReaderOptions.DisableColCountCheck` option that allows disabling
   exception thrown if a row does not have expected col count (fixes issue
   [#10](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/issues/10)).
 * BREAKING CHANGE: Rename `SepReaderOptions.UseFastFloat` to `DisableFastFloat`
   to follow a `Disable` convention for features enabled by default.
 * Minor breaking change to `SepWriter`, which now always writes line ending for
   last row to ensure row count consistent for empty columns.
 * Expand [README.md](https://github.com/nietras/Sep/blob/main/README.md) with
   options and debuggability.

## Even Faster Parsing
For detailed benchmarks incl. new ARM64 benchmarks on [Neoverse
N1](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/arm_holdings/microarchitectures/neoverse_n1)
see [GitHub](https://github.com/nietras/Sep). Below I instead try to highlight
the improvements from Sep 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 and Sylvan 1.3.1 to 1.3.2. Sylvan sees
an impressive 1.66x speedup and Sep 1.39x at the **Row** level. A win-win
scenario! 

Sep now hits ~10 GB/s on an AMD 5950X Zen 3 CPU when counting 2 bytes per char.
At 57.3 ns/row for a row with 25 columns for package assets benchmark this means
Sep spends just 2.3 ns or ~11 cycles (~5 GHz) per column for parsing only.

|    Method | Scope | Version |    MB/s | ns/row | Version |    MB/s | ns/row | Speedup |
|---------- |------ | -------:|--------:|-------:| -------:|--------:|-------:| -------:|
| Sep       |   Row |   0.1.0 |  7335.3 |   79.6 |   0.2.0 | 10191.6 |   57.3 |    1.39 |
| Sylvan    |   Row |   1.3.1 |  4952.1 |  117.9 |   1.3.2 |  8223.5 |   71.0 |    1.66 |
| Sep       |  Cols |   0.1.0 |  6119.8 |   95.4 |   0.2.0 |  7815.7 |   74.7 |    1.28 |
| Sylvan    |  Cols |   1.3.1 |  3546.0 |  164.6 |   1.3.2 |  4573.7 |  127.6 |    1.29 |
| Sep       | Asset |   0.1.0 |   775.0 |  753.3 |   0.2.0 |   810.6 |  720.2 |    1.05 |
| Sylvan    | Asset |   1.3.1 |   609.7 |  957.5 |   1.3.2 |   648.3 |  900.5 |    1.06 |

## SepReader Debuggability (Row Line Number Range)
Debuggability is an important part of any library and while this is still a work
in progress for Sep, `SepReader` does have a unique feature when looking at it's
row in a debug context. Given the below example code:
```csharp
var text = """
           Key;Value
           A;"1
           2
           3"
           B;"Apple
           Banana
           Orange
           Pear"
           """;
using var reader = Sep.Reader().FromText(text);
foreach (var row in reader)
{
    // Hover over row when breaking here
    if (Debugger.IsAttached && row.RowIndex == 2) { Debugger.Break(); }
}
```
and you are hovering over `row` when the break is triggered then this will show
something like:
```
  2:[5..9] = 'B;"Apple\r\nBanana\r\nOrange\r\nPear"
```
This has the format shown below. 
```
<ROWINDEX>:[<LINENUMBERRANGE>] = '<ROW>'
```
Note how this shows line number range `[FromIncl..ToExcl]`, as in C# [range
expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges#systemrange),
so that one can easily find the row in question in `notepad` or similar. This
means Sep has to track line endings inside quotes and is an example of a feature
that makes Sep a bit slower but which is a price considered worth paying.
