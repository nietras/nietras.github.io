Software engineer and craftsman at heart with a passion for core 
components development, performance and machine learning. I have
a Masters degree in Computer Vision and Graphics and +20 years
hands on experience in designing and implementing 
algorithms, working systems and machine learning pipelines.

Responsible for many software components and tools used by skilled 
co-workers. Relentless pursuer of reducing friction and improving 
quality and process by adopting modern development practices. 
Programmer - with a love for .NET/C# ❤. 

A few more points about me 😀:
* I have been programming since I was a kid. 
  In C++ for +20 years and C# for +12 years (as of 2020).
  * The first computer my family got was from [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari) and was the kind that had an accompanying book with programs you could type in. 
    When we wanted to play a game we, therefore, had to type it first.
    My very first programming experience.
  * Next we, of course, got a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), which I still own 😁.

* I love reading about CPU, GPU, TPU (xPUs) architectures and
  ISAs (❤ Agner Fogs [ForwardCom](https://github.com/forwardcom)).
  Always looking forward to new CPU/GPU/SOC reviews on www.anandtech.com.
* Listed as "Inspiring Open Source Contributors" on Adam Sitnick's
[awesome .NET performance list](https://github.com/adamsitnik/awesome-dot-net-performance) 👍.
* I have contributed a bit to a few different repositories. 
  Among others
[dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr),
[dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) (now
superceeded by the unified 
[dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)),
[dotnet/performance](https://github.com/dotnet/performance) and
[microsoft/onnxruntime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime).
* I always assemble my own developer PC.
